EXPERIENCE
Physicist and Tracking Instrument Analyst 	 (2/2009-present)
US Naval Air Warfare Station  	China Lake, California 
Created a data quality assurance program for data test and evaluation, and applied these techniques to other development projects. Analyzed tracking and surveillance instrumentation datasets. Created methods and algorithms to triangulate trajectory positions, fuse datasets, and estimate trajectory paths with Kalman filtering techniques. Wrote many computer programs with easy to use GUI to streamline data analysis and processing. Became very proficient in MatLab, and HTML interface programs that use VB applets. Used knowledge of GPS and GIS to create maps for visualizing trajectories. Documented all procedures in very functional internal website created for easy user access and understanding.
