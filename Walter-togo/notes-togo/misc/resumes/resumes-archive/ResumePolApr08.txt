SUMMARY
I have a solid science and engineering background, with strong analytical skills to attack and analyze problems. I’m politically active; I’ve volunteered for many causes, environmental issues, and progressive candidates. I’m well organized and I can manage projects and campaigns well. Additionally, I’ve recently completed an MS in project management. 

PROFESSOR & LECTURER
- Teach graduate aerospace classes in space environment, space applications, remote sensing, space mission and launch operations, GPS technology with GIS integration, and space policy.  
- Teach undergraduate classes in modern navigation and map use. 
- Won a Faculty Course Development award from the Wyoming NASA Space Grant Consortium in 2005 to develop a GPS technology class with GIS integration for Embry-Riddle 
- Won two project development awards in 2006 from the Wyoming NASA Space Grant Consortium and Embry-Riddle, to design and build a nano-satellite that demonstrates active orbital modification. Recently won another grant to design and develop a small satellite navigation system. 
- Serve on graduate capstone project committees, advise students, and recommend curriculum changes.

POLITICAL VOLUNTEER & ORGANIZER
Very familiar with environmental issues and progressive causes, both local and nationally. Have participated in political campaigns and written commentary letters on a variety of subjects, such as: 

Managed Growth: 
- Helped with Colorado Proposition 24 in several ways, including funding it. Gave strategic suggestions to COPIRG and the Colorado Environmental Coalition, and attended organizational meetings. Distributed literature and wrote letters to state newspapers and legislators regarding the wisdom of growth control, and submitted rebuttals against opponents of growth control. 
- Helped with both Golden’s slow growth ordinance campaign and with growth concerns in Boulder, 1995. 
- Worked with “Citizens for Predictable Growth,” to promote and strategize Arvada’s slow growth campaigns in 1997 and 1999. Distributed literature and petitioned for an amendment to the city’s constitution. 
- Helped with Colorado’s School Impact Fee proposal, petitioning for signatures and increasing awareness of the cause. 
- Worked on additional managed growth issues. 

Helped promote California’s Propositions 12 and 13, the State Parks, Open Space, and Clean Water Act,
in spring of 2000. Also promoted awareness of the Ballona Wetlands in Los Angeles, stressing their value as one of the last open space regions and the danger of building upon the land. 

Contributed to miscellaneous causes, such as commenting on the proposed television towers on Eldorado Mtn. and their effect on the radio quiet zone north of Boulder, Table Mountain Observatory. Gave legislative input concerning unfair practices by a state college on students. 

PROJECT ORGANIZER & MANAGER
- Responsible for organizing a large and growing annual event, "The Boulder Polar Bear Club's Ice Plunge," for the Boulder community since 1994. Responsibilities include: event insurance, ensuring that safety requirements are met, coordinating with Boulder Parks Dept. personnel, arranging for ice removal and hot tubs, working with sponsors, organizing volunteers, and providing refreshments, etc. The event is now a fund raiser for Alzheimer’s disease association. 
- Designed a modern navigation class for the university I teach at that utilizes GPS technology and integrates GIS. Those within the faculty consider this class very useful and needed for today’s space science and land-use majors. 
- Organized and managed students to assist with designing and building a small-satellite. 


SCIENTIFIC RESEARCHER
- Researched global electromagnetic resonances and solar wind induced geomagnetic field-line resonances for space weather contributions. Built many ground data acquisition stations to observe the phenomena. 
- Modeled scattering from GPS signals to better understand GPS multi-path problems that affect airport navigation. 
- Investigated cross-borehole electromagnetic probing, or radar, to characterize rock properties and effluent between the boreholes. Conducted several field studies, and built a model water tank to test antennas. 
- Researched external acoustic detection of fluid levels to monitor fluid levels in borehole fracture tanks. 
- Evaluated the feasibility of projects and ideas. 
- Presented papers, posters, and talks about scientific research, particularly in space physics and small satellites. 
- Designed and built proto-devices such as radiometers, a model infrared hygrometer to measure water vapor in helium for a nuclear power plant, and other electronic devices. 
- Extensive background in electronics and electrical engineering from several years of electronic repair work and many advanced electrical engineering and electromagnetic classes.  
- Very computer literate: networked and configured PC’s, interfaced data acquisition systems to PCs, and networked computer systems to the Internet for remote data retrieval.  

GEOPHYSICAL & ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
- Conducted induced polarization (IP) survey and subsequent data processing to determine the depth to a permeable limestone layer for renewable geothermal exploration near Larderello, Italy.  
- Assisted electrical loop-on-loop surveys to determine the extent of contaminate flows from both the Rocky Mountain Arsenal and a gold mining heap-leach site in California.  
- Operated ground-penetrating radar and VLF EM induction mapping to delineate near-surface soil disturbances around an old landfill dump.  
- Conducted magnetometer and shallow seismic refraction geophysical surveys in Nevada to map subsurface geologic structures.  
- Conducted a magnetic gradiometer survey to find drilled & abandoned oil wells potentially causing inter-strata contamination near a waste depository.  
- Potential field mapping using gravity and magnetics to determine basement rocks, and identify large metal structures. 
- Designed, built, and deployed GPS-synchronized magnetometer data acquisition systems for observing magnetospheric phenomena.
