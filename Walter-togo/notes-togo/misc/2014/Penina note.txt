Hi Penina,

I had a recommendation to contact you by a Carolyn McDonald of NavtechGPS, from where I've taken some Navtech classes while working at China Lake Naval Base (I also know Ray Esposito). Would CU have any GPS or GPS technology related openings, even temporary? I'm job hunting now, and would like to reenter the field. Any other recommendations would be very helpful.

Thanks,
