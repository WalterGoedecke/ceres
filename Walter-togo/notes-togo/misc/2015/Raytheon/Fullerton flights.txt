Hi Scott, 

Assuming that I would fly on Tuesday, June 30, and return July 2, in two days, there are fewer flights through Ontario (ONT) than through Los Angeles Intl. Airport (LAX), even though Ontario is closer to Fullerton. 

At Unities Airlines, several round trip flights are available, at about $600, while the fares through Ontario are about $900. 

Southwest, another airline, charges about $730 from LAX, while fares through ONT are about the same. Delta has limited flights that do not stop at Salt Lake City, or Minneapolis, somewhat out of the route. 

While the flights through LAX are numerous and less expensive, the travel back and forth is more, and perhaps if I finish my interview on Wednesday, assuming no follow-up on Thursday, a flight out on Thursday may not be possible, but would probably be going through Ontario. I would not mind spending the night in Los Angeles again on Wednesday, as I appreciate the interview. 

Assuming an interview on Wednesday, I would shoot for a late afternoon flight or evening tomorrow from Denver, and a return filght either Wednesday after the interview, or the next day is fine. 

Thank you, 
Walter Goedecke
