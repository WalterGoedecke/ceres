        <div id="wrapabout">
            <p>Growing up between Seattle and Boulder, I’ve lived a life of unusual circumstance that inspires me to be just as much focused, as I am <id class="aboutfont">creative</id>. Being personable, motivated, and clever, there’s not much I will let slow me down. Anything coming my way is considered an opportunity. And if opportunities aren’t coming my way I will make them. At just 22 years young, I have independently travelled, supported my way through school, and developed a broad skill set involving anything from humans to computers.</p>

            <p>I started my communication major at a spritely 17, just weeks out of early high school graduation. From there, I thought I’d be a doctor, entrepreneur, or even a chef! But it was when a friend of mine suggested the ad program that I found something I was good at and liked. My double major in <id class="aboutfont">Communication</id> and <id class="aboutfont">Advertising</id> led me to my minor in <id class="aboutfont">technology, arts, and media</id> and it’s been true love ever since. I am creative and I am meticulous and I am in love with design and advertising.</p>

            <p>It is an industry built on stringent and constant innovation. Ever changing, I thrive on those problems that need solutions outside of black and white. I'm more about delivering, than bullshit. I am <id class="aboutfont">passionate</id> about the work I put forward because it is a labor of love. If given a project I have never seen before, I will figure it out. There is no greater sense of accomplishment than <id class="aboutfont">relentless ideation</id> that fits one perfect and ultimate result. I realize that just anyone can slap this onto their portfolio in the hopes of getting hired but I choose to stick to my truth. Scope my portfolio or call me out. I've got what it takes to thrive in this industry. I know it. So send something my way or else I’ll come after it, let’s get busy people.
