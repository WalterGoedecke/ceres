                  Hi Eric,

                  I hope you're doing well.

                  I've used C++ very much for different projects,
            and I'm tutoring someone in
                  C#, an abbreviated version that uses GUI's, but
            doesn't use memory
                  functions. Is this version you're using a command
            line version, or does it
                  require some GUI, such as Microsoft .NET? If only
            command line programming,
                  I should be competent, as with the python.

                  Perhaps you could send me a problem for me to see
            the complexity, as you
                  did with the python ones. I'm gone this weekend to
            Los Angeles, and have to
                  go to Northrop Grummond on Tuesday, but I'm free
            other days.

                  Walter

                        Hi, Walter I actually have a question for
            you regarding your
                        programing skills, and the
                        question is if you have any experience with
            C++ and coding in
                        C++ and we wont have to
                        meet this week for homework or projects but
            maybe next week if
                        you are able to send me
                        a schedule ill see if any times match with
            my schedule.
